# git-merge-polite
This is a merge driver I needed which is essentially the union merge strategy but always puts your changes after the ones from the branch you are merging from.

If you think this is useful in anyway feel free to use it.

* You will need to add this custom driver to your .git/config. You can copy the merge driver you need from the .gitconfig file.
* Then you can use the merge driver in your .gitattributes file like the other drivers
